# 10-Week Plan to Solve 50 LeetCode Problems

## Goal
Become proficient in solving algorithmic problems by tackling 50 LeetCode tasks, starting from zero knowledge in algorithms.

## Time Commitment
40 minutes per day.

## Phase 1: Foundations (2 Weeks)
### Objective
Understand basic algorithms and data structures.

- **Day 1-4:** Learn basic algorithms (sorting, searching).
- **Day 5-8:** Study basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues).
- **Day 9-10:** Dive into complexity analysis (Big O notation).
- **Day 11-14:** Review concepts and solve simple problems.

## Phase 2: Beginner Level Practice (3 Weeks)
### Objective
Begin solving problems on LeetCode.

- **Day 15-21:** Solve 1-2 "Easy" problems daily, focusing on arrays and strings.
- **Day 22-28:** Continue with "Easy" problems on linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Day 29-35:** Explore "Easy" sorting and searching algorithm problems.

## Phase 3: Intermediate Level Practice (4 Weeks)
### Objective
Tackle "Medium" problems and broaden your knowledge.

- **Day 36-42:** Solve "Medium" problems, starting with trees and graphs.
- **Day 43-49:** Introduce dynamic programming basics with related "Medium" problems.
- **Day 50-56:** Continue practicing "Medium" problems on complex data structures.
- **Day 57-63:** Review and re-solve challenging problems.

## Phase 4: Consistent Practice and Review (1 Week)
### Objective
Solidify knowledge and address any gaps.

- **Day 64-67:** Review challenging topics and practice related problems.
- **Day 68-70:** Mix of "Easy" and "Medium" problems for confidence and reinforcement.

## Duration
Approximately **10 weeks** to solve 50 tasks, incorporating both learning and problem-solving phases.

## Success Tips
- **Consistency is key:** Regular, focused sessions are crucial.
- **Seek understanding, not memorization:** Grasp the underlying concepts.
- **Regular reviews:** Revisit difficult problems to solidify your understanding.
- **Leverage resources:** Utilize tutorials, forums, and discussion boards for diverse problem-solving strategies.
